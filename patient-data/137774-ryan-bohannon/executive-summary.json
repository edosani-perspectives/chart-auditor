Admitted in a state of crisis following a relapse just three weeks after a previous treatment episode, his journey reflects a move from 'escapism' to a confrontational processing of grief. The clinical focus shifted from physical stabilization (detox) to addressing the 'backlog of feelings' associated with the deaths of his twin and older brother within a 10-day span in 2023.",
      "core_clinical_dynamic": "The intersection of 'survival guilt' and 'perfectionism.' Ryan's reliance on alcohol and stimulants (Vyvanse/Adderall) served as an emotional buffer against a dysfunctional family origin and the specific trauma of finding his mother after a suicide attempt at age 8."

      "grief_work": "Transitioned from emotional numbness to active processing of his twin brother's death through grief workbook exercises and 'Goodbye Letters' to his drug of choice.",
      "relational_repair": "Participated in a tearful conjoint session with his wife on 12/31/2025, moving from avoidance to taking responsibility for his emotional unavailability."
