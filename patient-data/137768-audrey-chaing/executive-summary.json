    "Clinical_Justification": {
      "The_Golden_Thread": "Audrey Chaing is a 45-year-old female presenting with a severe Ketamine Use Disorder (up to 1g/day) and acute Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Her clinical downward spiral was precipitated by the recent emergence of repressed childhood sexual abuse memories, complicated by a miscarriage and the suicides of both a former partner and a close friend. This constellation of trauma led to street-sourcing ketamine and two involuntary psychiatric holds (5150) in the 15 days prior to admission.",
      "Medical_Necessity_Narrative": "Residential 3.5 care is required due to acute psychiatric instability (ASAM Dimension 3) and withdrawal potential/PAWS (Dimension 1). The patient is currently experiencing 3:00 AM flashbacks, extreme sensory overstimulation (noise/light sensitivity), and 'meltdowns' that render her unable to safely manage symptoms in an outpatient setting. Her primary support system is compromised by a partner who is not currently sober, creating a high risk for immediate relapse upon discharge to a lower level of care."
    },
    "Dimension_Breakdown": {
      "Dimension_1_Withdrawal_Potential": "High risk for Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS) associated with heavy Ketamine use. Requiring Q6H vital signs and gabapentin titration for anxiety/detox support.",
      "Dimension_2_Biomedical": "Complicated by an elevated autoimmune antibody and a healing wrist wound requiring monitoring for infection/self-neglect.",
      "Dimension_3_Emotional_Behavioral": "Critical risk. Patient has active PTSD symptoms, including significant introversion, social withdrawal, and recurring nightmares/flashbacks. Recent 5150 holds demonstrate an inability to maintain safety independently.",
      "Dimension_4_Readiness_to_Change": "Patient is in the 'Action' stage, seeking treatment due to a fear of being 'out of control,' though she is still highly susceptible to environmental triggers.",
      "Dimension_5_Relapse_Potential": "Severe. The convergence of 'December trauma triggers' (anniversary dates) and street-sourced ketamine use indicates that without residential containment, the patient is unlikely to maintain sobriety.",
      "Dimension_6_Recovery_Environment": "Unstable. Living alone with a non-sober boyfriend in the immediate vicinity provides a high-trigger environment for substance use."
    },
    "Reclaim_Milestones": {
      "Initial_Stabilization": "Completed 72-hour observation; vital signs WNL; medication compliant.",
      "Trauma_Integration": "Initial BPS completed. Identified childhood abuse and recent deaths as primary drivers of substance abuse.",
      "Environment_Planning": "Aftercare plan initiated to address housing instability and sober support network."
    },
    "Clinical_Recommendation": "Continue Residential (3.5) status. Focus on medication stabilization (gabapentin/buspirone) and trauma-informed psychotherapy to address the 0300-0400 flashbacks before transitioning to PHP."
