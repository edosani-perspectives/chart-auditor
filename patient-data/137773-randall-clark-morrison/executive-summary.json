      "journey_summary": "Randall, a 64-year-old environmental lawyer, entered treatment after a significant relapse following one year of sobriety. His journey is defined by a dichotomy between high-level professional success and a self-described 'toxic' domestic environment. His relapse cycle was triggered by holiday stressors and a pattern of 'substance switching' (MDMA to Alcohol). Clinically, his journey moved from a 'hero/caretaker' role—where he sponsored six people in early sobriety while ignoring his own needs—to an emerging focus on radical self-preservation and boundary setting.",
      "behavioral_patterns": "The client exhibited a 'walking on eggshells' mentality at home, leading to emotional suppression. In treatment, he began to process the resentment of being 'used' by his spouse and stepdaughter, eventually recognizing that his domestic situation was a primary barrier to long-term recovery."
